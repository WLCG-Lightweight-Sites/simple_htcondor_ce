If the $(UID_DOMAIN) on the submitting machine is different than the $(UID_DOMAIN) on the machine that runs a job, then HTCondor runs the job as the user nobody"}
  gss_assist_gridmap_cache_expiration: {type: int(), required: true, use_default: true, description: "The length of time, in seconds, to cache the result of the Globus mapping lookup result when using Globus to map certificates to HTCondor user names. The lookup only occurs when the canonical name GSS_ASSIST_GRIDMAP is present in the HTCondor map file. The default value is 0 seconds, which is a special value that disables caching. The cache uses the DN and VOMS FQAN as a key; very rare Globus configurations that utilize other certificate attributes for the mapping may cause the cache to return a different user than Globus."}

The files are named history, with the job's cluster and process number appended."}
